## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At Evox, we take security seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities within the Evox application, please report them immediately to our security team at admin@evoxs.xyz. We appreciate your help in keeping our platform safe and secure.

## Security Measures

### Encryption

Evox Gateway employs strong encryption methods provided by Cryptox to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data. Cryptographic operations such as Initialization Vectors (IV) and keys are utilized to secure sensitive information.

### Authentication and Access Control

Authentication mechanisms are implemented to verify the identity of users accessing the gateway. This includes username and password authentication along with additional security measures such as IP address logging and device tracking. Access control mechanisms are in place to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data.

### Secure Communication

Encrypted chats are facilitated within the Evox application to ensure secure communication between users. This prevents eavesdropping and unauthorized access to chat contents.

### Regular Security Audits

We conduct regular security audits and assessments of the Evox application to identify and address any potential security vulnerabilities or weaknesses. This proactive approach helps in maintaining the overall security posture of our platform.
